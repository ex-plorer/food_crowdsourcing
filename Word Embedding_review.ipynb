The bowls offered included prawn, chicken or vegetables but if you love to try everything then opt for the mixed bowl like I did. They also had rice, soba and thin udon noodles as options and 4 levels of spiciness for their tendon sauce. My mixed bowl came with too many ingredients! Notable mentions include the succulent chicken breast, the ginormous slice of kelp, shitake and enoki mushrooms and 2 large ebi tempura head-on and tail-on! I think the prawns must be the signature of this tendon place as it is distinctively more delicious than the ones served at Kohaku and Ginza! I went up to max spice level for the sauce and boy did it pack some  but nothing Singaporean spicy food lovers can't handle. My verdict?

We ordered: * Chilli Crab Pasta - it was actually rather spicy but over-bearing. The taste was not really like the Chilli crab you get in restaurants but it's still nice. The crab meat was also generous in amount, so much so that there was enough ingredients for every mouthful.  Red Dot Pasta - this pasta was with Japanese fusion flair. The seafood (scallop, prawns, squid and Japanese fish roe) was fresh and adequate for the pasta. I also liked the familiar sweetish savoury Japanese sauce that coated the pasta.  Attitude Dude - a double-patty burger with onions and coleslaw and all the other yummies. And truth be told, it was really great from the first bite! Hubby said price for quality, it beat many other burger joints.  Chicken Cheese Sausage Hotdog - an item from kid's menu but the serving was actually enough for a small adult eater. Taste was good too, the sourdough bun was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Sausage was really cheesy and my daughter was so impressed with that! The hand cut fries was also very well fried and seasoned! I have eaten many many fries in my life and this really ranked quite high in terms of taste and texture! Didn't expect to have had such a satisfactory meal here. Will definitely recommend to friends and family!\n",

However for the number of people in line, the wait was relatively not that long. Food wise, it was pretty great for the price, with each dish coming up to $6 or so. The phad thai tang hoon was the winner for me. It was something different from the usual phad thai, and the glass noodles were just so good. I really liked the fried pork with garlic - then again you can never go wrong with this dish. The Tom yum soup with coconut milk was interesting, but I still prefer the original I think. All in all, a pretty good meal that's definitely worth it's price, that is, if you're willing to wait it out.\n",

I decided to go for the popular lawrys cut and the boy went for the fillet mignon (200g $79) as he insisted against roast beast. The verdict? I will say taste wise i prefer fillet mignon, but the signature roast prime rib lawrys cut (285g $109) is a uniquely lawrys experience with the spinning salad bowl and Yorkshire pudding. We also ordered a single lobster tail ($29) and bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon ($80) to go with it.

Steaming hot sauce flowing out from the charcoal toast, and with the combination of a colddd scoop of ice cream, it was pretty good! However, it was a pity how the sauce made the charcoal toast soggy on the inside and hence gave it a weird texture  The Thai Milk Tea Ice Cream was also a little icy, but definitely had a strong flavour. Honestly, I'd still prefer the Ferrero Rocher Toast ($12.90), which was buttery throughout, and crisp on the outside fluffy on the inside. The texture of that toast just made me melt!!We waited for pretty long for the toast to arrive, and the staff actually got our order wrong (they made Thai Green Milk Tea sauce instead), but they gave us a scoop of Dark Chocolate on the house (!!!) which was really thick and OMG it was pretty damn good \n",

I mean, $13.80 for Bak Chor Mee? Abel lost his shit. Hahaha but it was a screwy dessert that looked like a savoury hawker treat - confusing, but delicious. The strands of \"mee\", mango vermicelli, the fishball, coconut parfait, the \"minced meat\" sesame snow, \"lard\" nuts, and at the bottom, what is usually ketchup, chilli and vinegar, was a raspberry reduction and balsamic jelly. It was (is) a kooky dish to try, fun to look at and even more enjoyable to eat. They achieved a balance of flavours despite messing with the balance of Hawker Powers That Be. Hahaha\n",

And simply put, it's the best new sandwich. Think of a McSpicy on steroids but even better, and you've got the Pablo. It's one of the messiest sandwiches in the HB lineup due to how outrageously thick the delicious chicken patty is, and how lavishly that sumptuous spicy sesame mayo is spread all over the bread. It can get a little rich due to all the delicious elements within the sandwich, so the smaller eaters may want to bring a pal to tag team this sandwich.\n",

We had the mango bingsu out of the 5 flavours (Black Sesame, Mango, Oreo, Soy Bean, Strawberry) from the menu. Their shaved ice was amazingly fine and soft, and the scoop of mango ice cream that came with it was rich and creamy. The mango chunks are sweeter and more fragrant as it was \"marinated\" with the chef's secret recipe which he did not wish to reveal. Initially there wasn't a strong milky taste, but it became stronger when mixing it up with condensed milk nestled underneath the soft layers of shaved ice, which had the right amount of sweetness to it. Even though Nunsongyee is still my number 1, but this is definitely still one of the better bingsu that we had. Thank you so much once again for your hospitality! \n",

It's where you can famous Chwee kueh, prawn noodles and Lor Mee under one roof. The Lor Mee gravy was not too starchy nor salty and the thick noodle texture were just nice. Add a bit of vinegar and garlic to enhance the flavour of the Lor ( dark sauce ). I ordered the $4 version, where it comes with shark meat instead the normal Ngoh Hiang and pork slices. The shark meat, may has a crispy exterior, but there was no difference in term of texture and taste between normal fish meats. I would rather have my Ngoh Hiang and pork slices!

The Crack Pie is a dessert that originated and became a bestseller at New York's famous Momofuku Milk Bar. To try one closer to home, visit Carvers & Co. in Katong where they bake their own ($9.90 per slice). Featuring ingredients such as cream, eggs, both brown and white sugar, it truly is pure decadence.The smooth, lightly-firm paste filling is just the right degree of caramelly-sweet with a hint of salty. Contrasting well with that is the oatmeal crust base. Because the whole thing is so darn rich, plus it comes with a big scoop of vanilla ice-cream, I recommend sharing a slice first. Order another if it proves too good to stop at one \n",

Anyway, there aren't many places in Singapore that serve both Hainanese chicken rice AND steamboat together. This one happens to be my favourite. And a lot has to do with the awesome chicken rice chilli sauce - I dip everything in it!Unlike the trending buffet style, steamboat here comes in small or big sets, so just double up for bigger groups. Each set contains an assortment of seafood, fishball, sea cucumber, meat, eggs and vegetable. You can always inform the staff what you prefer to exclude or add more of. Of course, there's always a la carte orders too.Besides chicken rice, other specialities like Hainanese pork chop and satay are also available. Don't miss out on their aromatic \"kopi-o\" either. Our bill for half a chicken, a small steamboat set, an extra plate of beef, 3 bowls of rice and 3 cups of \"kopi-o\" = $54. I find that to be pretty good value.\n",
